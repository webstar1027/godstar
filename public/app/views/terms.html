                        In order to ensure that you do not experience any interruption or loss of services due to the lapse of any particular subscription period, the HipRez Services operate with automatic renewal, on a recurring-fees basis (except where explicitly stated otherwise by HipRez in writing). Accordingly, where applicable, HipRez will attempt to automatically renew the applicable HipRez Service(s) for a renewal period equal in time to the original subscription period for such Service, and automatically charge you the applicable Fees using the payment method you have on file with HipRez.

                        For example, if the original subscription period for a Service is one month, each of its renewal periods (where applicable) will be for one month. Therefore, unless you cancel the applicable HipRez Service(s), HipRez will automatically renew such Service when it comes up for renewal, and charge you the applicable recurring Fees. In order to avoid any interruptions or loss of services due to failure to process renewal charges prior to the expiration of the subscription period then in effect, we reserve our right (but shall not be obligated) to charge for the upcoming renewal period up to two (2) weeks before such renewal period actually commences. In the event of failure to collect the Fees owed by you, we may in our sole discretion (but shall not be obligated to) retry to collect on a later time, and/or suspend or cancel your User Account, without further notice.

When you purchase a monthly subscription, auto-renew is automatically selected in your account. At the end of the monthly subscription period, you will automatically be signed up and billed for an additional subscription term of 30 days. If you do not wish to renew your subscription, you have to cancel it prior to the end of your current subscription term. You will remain on HipRez subscription until the last paid for period expires.

                        Your annual subscription for HipRez will start after receiving your payment and will continue for a period of one year. Annual subscriptions are paid in full in advance. When you purchase an annual subscription, auto-renew is automatically selected in your account. At the end of the annual subscription period, HipRez will sign you up and bill you for an additional subscription term of one year. If you do not wish to renew your subscription, you have to cancel it prior to the end of your current subscription term. You will remain on HipRez subscription until the last paid for period expires.

                        Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, you are and shall be solely responsible to verify and ensure the successful renewal of the HipRez Services you use (whether or not such HipRez Services are subject to automatic subscription renewals). Accordingly, you shall be solely responsible with respect to any discontinuation of any HipRez Services previously purchased by you, including due to a cancellation, failure to charge the applicable recurring Fees, or due to any HipRez Services not being subject to automatic subscription renewals. You acknowledge and agree that you shall not have any claims against HipRez in relation to the discontinuation of any HipRez Services or Third Party Services, for whatever reason.

                        If you are not satisfied with HipRez Services that are subject to a Fee for a period of service or subscription commitment and which is your initial purchase of such service, you may provide notice of cancellation for any reason within fourteen (14) days of having first ordered or activated such HipRez Services (the “Refund” and “Refund Period”). The Refund is applicable only to the initial purchase of HipRez services which is the resume site template and production of resume offered on the website. The Refund is not applicable to any additional purchases, upgrades, modification or renewals of HipRez Services. If you reside in a jurisdiction which requires a longer Refund Period, we will of course be happy to accommodate such requirements in accordance with all applicable laws. If HipRez receives such notice within such Refund Period, HipRez will refund to you the amount HipRez charged you for such HipRez Services, in currency you were originally charged in, and cancel them accordingly. Please note that the Refund amount may be different than the amount you were charged due to currency changes and third party fees. HipRez will not be responsible for any differences caused by change of currency exchange rates or fees you were charged by third parties. After the Refund Period, the Fees paid by you are non-refundable and non-cancellable. In addition, if we find that a notice of cancellation has been given in bad faith or in an illegitimate attempt to avoid payment for services actually received and enjoyed, we reserve our right to still charge the User who provided such notice for any HipRez Services actually received, as permitted by law.

                        Please note: Certain services purchased on or through the HipRez Services may be non-refundable. These include Third Party Services such as domains. The terms of each purchased service or application are indicated on the HipRez Website and/or as part of or during the process of purchasing such services or applications. It is your obligation to verify your ability to cancel a service prior to purchasing it. HipRez will not refund any amounts paid for non-refundable Paid Services, applications or Third Party Services.
